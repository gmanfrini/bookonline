        "description": "technology is constantly evolving, and blockchain is taking development to new places, as mobile did a decade ago - and ethereum is the leading platform for creating this new wave of applications. this book reveals everything you need to create a robust decentralized application (more commonly known as dapp). unlike other books on the topic, this one focuses on the web application layer, and guides you in creating great experiences on top of the ethereum blockchain. you'll review the challenges and differences involved in developing dapps as opposed to traditional web applications.\n\r\nafter a brief introduction to blockchain history and ethereum in particular, you'll jump directly into building a sample decentralized application, to familiarize yourself with all the moving pieces. this book offers specific chapters on querying and rendering data from the blockchain, reacting to events, interacting with user accounts, sending transactions, managing gas, handling confirmations and reorganizations, and more. you will also find a chapter dedicated to solidity that will give you the necessary means to understand and even build your own smart contracts. \n\r\nother important topics covered include building backend servers that act as indexing layers, and managing storage efficiently with solutions like the interplanetary file system, or ipfs. last but not least, you will find chapters that examine the biggest problems on ethereum today: onboarding and scalability. these include the state of the art of the available strategies to tackle them, such as meta-transactions, smart accounts, ens, state channels, sidechains, and more.",

        "description": "no matter how much experience you have with javascript, odds are you don't fully understand the language. as part of the \"you don't know js\" series, this compact guide focuses on new features available in ecmascript 6 (es6), the latest version of the standard upon which javascript is built.\n\r\nlike other books in this series, you don't know js: es6 & beyond dives into trickier parts of the language that many javascript programmers either avoid or know nothing about. armed with this knowledge, you can achieve true javascript mastery.\n\r\nlearn new es6 syntax that eases the pain points of common programming idioms; organize code with iterators, generators, modules, and classes; express async flow control with promises combined with generators; use collections to work more efficiently with data in structured ways; leverage new api helpers, including array, object, math, number, and string; extend your program's capabilities through meta programming; preview features likely coming to js beyond es6.",

        "description": "statistical methods are a key part of data science, yet few data scientists have formal statistical training. courses and books on basic statistics rarely cover the topic from a data science perspective. the second edition of this popular guide adds comprehensive examples in python, provides practical guidance on applying statistical methods to data science, tells you how to avoid their misuse, and gives you advice on what's important and what's not.\n\r\nmany data science resources incorporate statistical methods but lack a deeper statistical perspective. if you're familiar with the r or python programming languages and have some exposure to statistics, this quick reference bridges the gap in an accessible, readable format.\n\r\nwith this book, you'll learn: why exploratory data analysis is a key preliminary step in data science; how random sampling can reduce bias and yield a higher-quality dataset, even with big data; how the principles of experimental design yield definitive answers to questions; how to use regression to estimate outcomes and detect anomalies; key classification techniques for predicting which categories a record belongs to; statistical machine learning methods that \"learn\" from data; unsupervised learning methods for extracting meaning from unlabeled data.",

        "description": "by applying this book's principles, you can create code that accommodates new requirements and unforeseen scenarios without significant rewrites. gary mclean hall describes agile best practices, principles, and patterns for designing and writing code that can evolve more quickly and easily, with fewer errors, because it doesn't impede change.\n\r\nnow revised, updated, and expanded, adaptive code, second edition adds indispensable practical insights on kanban, dependency inversion, and creating reusable abstractions. drawing on over a decade of agile consulting and development experience, mclean hall has updated his best-seller with deeper coverage of unit testing, refactoring, pure dependency injection, and more.\n\r\nmaster powerful new ways to: write code that enables and complements scrum, kanban, or any other agile framework; develop code that can survive major changes in requirements; plan for adaptability by using dependencies, layering, interfaces, and design patterns; perform unit testing and refactoring in tandem, gaining more value from both; use the \"golden master\" technique to make legacy code adaptive; build solid code with single-responsibility, open/closed, and liskov substitution principles; create smaller interfaces to support more-diverse client and architectural needs; leverage dependency injection best practices to improve code adaptability; apply dependency inversion with the stairway pattern, and avoid related anti-patterns.",

        "description": "c++ is an object-oriented enhancement of the c programming language and is becoming the language of choice for serious software development. c++ has crossed the single book complexity barrier. the individual features are not all that complex, but when put together in a program they interact in highly non-intuitive ways. many books discuss each of the features separately, giving readers the illusion that they understand the language. but when they try to program, they're in for a painful surprise. c++: the core language is for c programmers transitioning to c++. it's designed to get readers up to speed quickly by covering an essential subset of the language. the subset consists of features without which it's just not c++, and a handful of others that make it a reasonably useful language. you can actually use this subset (using any compiler) to get familiar with the basics of the language. once you really understand that much, it's time to do some programming and learn more from other books. after reading this book, you'll be far better equipped to get something useful out of a reference manual, a graphical user interface programming book, and maybe a book on the specific libraries you'll be using. c++: the core language includes sidebars that give overviews of all the advanced features not covered, so that readers know they exist and how they fit in. it covers features common to all c++ compilers, including those on unix, windows nt, windows, dos, and macintosh.",

        "description": "you need more than great dev tools to release great software; you need an efficient pipeline that takes advantage of modern agile development practices. serverless platforms like aws offer the basic building blocks you need to run code, store data, or process streaming information so you can focus on the features you want to provide, not get bogged down with the infrastructure. combined with an agile process, serverless architectures help create a quick feedback loop between developers, end users, and businesses, allowing for the quick prototyping and easy production roll-out you need to innovate and react on the fly.\n\r\nagile development for serverless platforms helps you start thinking about how to apply agile practices in fully serverless architectures. this book brings together excerpts from four manning books selected by danilo poccia, the author of aws lambda in action. these chapters are a fantastic way to lay the foundations for understanding the world of agile development on serverless architecture. with concepts from working with apis, serverless development patterns, designing an authentication system, and more, you'll see just how to tackle this new way to develop efficiently and effectively.",
